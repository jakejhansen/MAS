# AI & MAS 2018 - Group Declaration for PushPush

Date: May 30, 2018



## Code declaration

### Jacob Jon Hansen (s134097)

* subgoal ordering
* finding next goal
* finding paths from boxes to goals
* finding blocking boxes
* all of the heuristics

### Gandalf Saxe (s113093)

* level import stuff
* corner finder function
* all pairs shortest path module
* worked on subgoal ordering (generalized topological sort to allowing cycles)
* general A* pathfinder

### Both

We did a good deal of **pair programming** so the above is just an approximation, and the code we both touched is very overlapping.



## Report Declaration

### Jacob Jon Hansen (s134097)

- abstract
- background
- related work
- most of methods
- discussion & future work

### Gandalf Saxe (s113093)

- most of the introduction
- level design figures, incl. captions
- result tables
- lots of proof-reading / adjustment all over report

### Common

* methods
* experiments/results



Once again, we both had a hand in all of the report, but worked *mostly* on the parts described above.
