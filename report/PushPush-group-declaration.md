# AI & MAS 2018 - Group Declaration for PushPush

Date: May 30, 2018



### Jacob Jon Hansen (s134097)

* subgoal ordering
* finding next goal
* finding paths from boxes to goals
* finding blocking boxes
* all of the heuristics

### Gandalf Saxe (s113093)

* level import stuff
* corner finder function
* all pairs shortest path module
* worked on subgoal ordering (generalized topological sort to allowing cycles)
* general A* pathfinder



### Both

* We did a good deal of **pair programming** so the above is just an approximation, and the code we both touched is very overlapping.
